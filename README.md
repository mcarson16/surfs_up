# surfs_up
## Overview:
Using the sample data in the Hawaii.sqlite file, we calculated summary statistics for Oahu's temperatures in June and December to determine whether or not a business that doubled as a surf shop and ice cream stand would be sustainable year-round.

## Results:
- June

- The mean temperatures vary by a little less than 4 degrees.
- The minimum temperatures vary by roughly 8 degrees.
- The maximum temperatures vary by roughly 2 degrees.
- December temperatures have a slightly higher standard deviation

## Summary
- Looking at temperature alone, it seems like the shop could feasibly operate year-round. 
  - December has a lower minimum temperature, but the average temperatures are only about 4 degrees apart.
- Additional factor to consider: precipitation
